  integration with Lettuce.

- `AsyncConnectionPoolSupport.createBoundedObjectPool(…)` methods are
  now blocking to await pool initialization.

- `DecodeBufferPolicy` for fine-grained memory reclaim control.

- `RedisURI.toString()` renders masked password.

- `ClientResources.commandLatencyCollector(…)` refactored into
  `ClientResources.commandLatencyRecorder(…)` returning
  `CommandLatencyRecorder`.

## What’s new in Lettuce 5.3

- Improved SSL configuration supporting Cipher suite selection and
  PEM-encoded certificates.

- Fixed method signature for `randomkey()`.

- Un-deprecated `ClientOptions.pingBeforeActivateConnection` to allow
