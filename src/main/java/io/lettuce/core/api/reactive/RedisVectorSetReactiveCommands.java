/**
 * Reactive executed commands for Vector Sets
 * <p>
 * Vector sets are a Redis data type designed for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors. They support approximate
 * nearest neighbor search using the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Vector sets are particularly useful for machine learning applications, similarity search, recommendation systems, and other
 * use cases that involve high-dimensional vector data.
 *
 * @param <K> Key type.
 * @param <V> Value type.
