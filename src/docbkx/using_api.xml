  <title>Using the MyBatis API</title>

  <para>
    With MyBatis-Spring, you can continue to directly use the MyBatis API.
    Simply create an <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> in Spring using
    <literal>SqlSessionFactoryBean</literal> and use the factory in your code.
    In this case you will not have any MyBatis-Spring dependencies in your
    code; simply use the injected <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> in your
    DAOs:

    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class UserMapperSqlSessionImpl implements UserMapper {
  // SqlSessionFactory would normally be set by SqlSessionDaoSupport
  private SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory;

  public void setSqlSessionFactory(SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory) {
    this.sqlSessionFactory = sqlSessionFactory;
  }

  public User getUser(String userId) {
    // note standard MyBatis API usage - opening and closing the session manually
    SqlSession session = sqlSessionFactory.openSession();

    try {
      return (User) session.selectOne("sample.UserMapper.getUser", userId);
    } finally {
      session.close();
    }
  }
}]]></programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
    Note that this usage will <emphasis>not</emphasis> participate in any
    Spring transactions. Further, if the <literal>SqlSession</literal> is using a
    <literal>DataSource</literal> that is also being used by a Spring
    transaction manager and there is currently a transaction in progress, this
    code <emphasis>will</emphasis> throw an exception. For this reason, if you
    must use this style of access, you should not use a Spring transactional
    database connection.
  </para>
