<chapter id="templates_support">
  <title>SqlSessionTemplate and SqlSessionDaoSupport</title>

  <section id="templates_support.template">
    <title>SqlSessionTemplate</title>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> is the heart of MyBatis-Spring.
      This class is responsible for managing MyBatis
      <literal>SqlSession</literal>s, calling MyBatis SQL methods and
      translating exceptions. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for
      <literal>SqlSession</literal>. <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal>
      should <emphasis>always</emphasis> be used instead of
      <literal>SqlSession</literal> because the base MyBatis session cannot
      participate in Spring transactions. Switching between the two classes in
      the same application can cause data integrity issues.
    </para>

    <para>
      When calling SQL methods, including any method from Mappers returned from
      <literal>getMapper()</literal>,  <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal>
      will ensure that the <literal>SqlSession</literal> used is the one
      associated with the current Spring transaction. In addition, it manages
      the session life-cycle, including closing, committing or rolling back as
      necessary.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is usually not necessary to create or use a
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> directly. In most cases,
      <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal>, which uses a template internally,
      will be all that is needed. When access to an
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> is needed, it can be created using
      an <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> as a constructor argument.

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[SqlSessionTemplate sessionTemplate = new SqlSessionTemplate(sqlSessionFactory);]]></programlisting>
      Similarly, the template could be configured in a Spring XML file.
    </para>

    <para>
      In addition to all the SQL related methods in
      <literal>SqlSession</literal>, <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal>
      offers a generic <literal>execute</literal> method. This method takes a
      custom <literal>SqlSessionCallback</literal> as an argument so that you
      can execute more than one SQL method on a <literal>SqlSession</literal>:
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public void insertUser(final User user) {
  getSqlSessionTemplate().execute(new SqlSessionCallback<Object>() {
    public Object doInSqlSession(SqlSession sqlSession) {
      sqlSession.insert("org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapper.insertUser", user);
      sqlSession.insert("org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapper.insertAccount", user.getAccount());
      return null;
    }
  });
}]]></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that the <literal>execute</literal> method can also accept a
      <literal>ExecutorType</literal> parameter. This can be used if the
      desired execution method differs from the default set for the
      SqlSessionFactory. This will mostly be useful for performing batch SQL
      queries using <literal>ExecutorType.BATCH</literal>. The only caveat to
      this form of the method is that there <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be an
      existing transaction running with a different ExecutorType when this
      method is called. Either ensure that calls to
      <literal>execute(SqlSessionCallback, ExecutorType)</literal> run in a
      separate transaction, with PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW or with completely
      outside of a transaction.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="templates_support.daosupport">
    <title>SqlSessionDaoSupport</title>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal> is an abstract support class that
      builds a <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> for you. Calling
      <literal>getSqlSessionTemplate()</literal> gives you access to the
      template which can then be used to execute SQL methods, like the
      following:

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class UserMapperDaoImpl extends SqlSessionDaoSupport implements UserMapper {
  public User getUser(String userId) {
    return (User) getSqlSessionTemplate()
        .selectOne("org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapper.getUser", userId);
  }
}]]></programlisting>

      Usually <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal> is preferred to this class,
      since it requires no extra code. But, this class is useful if you need
      to do other non-MyBatis work in your DAO and concrete classes are
      required.
    </para>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal> is configured similarly to
      <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal>. It requires either an
      <literal>sqlSessionFactory</literal> or an
      <literal>sqlSessionTemplate</literal> property to be set. These can be
      set explicitly or autowired by Spring. If both properties are set, the
      SqlSessionFactory is ignored.
    </para>

    <para>
      Assuming a class <literal>UserMapperImpl</literal> that subclasses
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal>, it can be configured in Spring
      like the following:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="userMapperImpl" class="sample.UserMapperImpl">
  <!-- SqlSessionFactory property is autowired -->
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>
</chapter>
