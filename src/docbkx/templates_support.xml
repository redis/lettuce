<chapter id="templates_support">
  <title>Using an SqlSession</title>
  
  <para>
    In MyBatis you use the <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> to create an
    <literal>SqlSession</literal>. Once you have a session, you use it to
    execute your mapped statements, commit or rollback connections and
    finally, when it is no longer needed, you close the session. With
    MyBatis-Spring you don't need to use <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal>
    directly because your beans can be injected with a thread safe
    <literal>SqlSession</literal> that automatically commits, rollbacks and
    closes the session based on Spring's transaction configuration.
  </para>  
  
  <section id="templates_support.daosupport">
    <title>SqlSessionDaoSupport</title>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal> is an abstract support class that
      provides you with a <literal>SqlSession</literal>. Calling 
      <literal>getSqlSession()</literal> you will get a thread 
      safe <literal>SqlSession</literal> which can then be used to execute SQL
      methods, like the following:

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class UserMapperDaoImpl extends SqlSessionDaoSupport implements UserMapper {
  public User getUser(String userId) {
    return (User) getSqlSession()
        .selectOne("org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapper.getUser", userId);
  }
}]]></programlisting>

      Usually <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal> is preferred to this class,
      since it requires no extra code. But, this class is useful if you need
      to do other non-MyBatis work in your DAO and concrete classes are
      required.
    </para>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal> is configured similarly to
      <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal>. It requires either an
      <literal>sqlSessionFactory</literal> or an <literal>sqlSessionTemplate</literal> 
      property to be set. These can be set explicitly or autowired by Spring. 
      If both properties are set, the SqlSessionFactory is ignored.
    </para>

    <para>
      Assuming a class <literal>UserMapperImpl</literal> that subclasses
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal>, it can be configured in Spring
      like the following:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="userMapper" class="org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapperImpl">
  <property name="sqlSessionFactory" ref="sqlSessionFactory" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="templates_support.template">
    <title>SqlSessionTemplate</title>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> is the heart of MyBatis-Spring.
      This class is responsible for managing MyBatis <literal>SqlSessions</literal>, 
      calling MyBatis SQL methods and translating exceptions.
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> is thread safe and can be shared
      by multiple DAOs.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      When calling SQL methods, including any method from Mappers returned by
      <literal>getMapper()</literal>, <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal>
      will ensure that the <literal>SqlSession</literal> used is the one
      associated with the current Spring transaction. In addition, it manages
      the session life-cycle, including closing, committing or rolling back the
      session as necessary.
    </para> 
      
    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> implements
      <literal>SqlSession</literal> and is meant to be a drop-in replacement
      for MyBatis <literal>SqlSession</literal>.
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> should <emphasis>always</emphasis>
      be used instead of <literal>SqlSession</literal> because the base MyBatis
      <literal>SqlSession</literal> cannot participate in Spring transactions
      and is not thread safe. Switching between the two classes in the same
      application can cause data integrity issues.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is usually not necessary to create or use a
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> directly. In most cases,
      <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal>, which uses a template internally,
      will be all that is needed. When access to an
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> is needed, it can be created using
      an <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> as a constructor argument.

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[SqlSession sqlSsession = new SqlSessionTemplate(sqlSessionFactory);]]></programlisting>
      
      Similarly, the template could be configured in a Spring XML file.
    </para>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> has also a constructor that takes
      an <literal>ExecutorType</literal> as an argument. This allows you to
      construct, for example, a batch <literal>SqlSession</literal> but using
	  the following in Spring's configuration xml:  
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<bean id="sqlSession" class="org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionTemplate">
  <constructor-arg index="0" ref="sqlSessionFactory" />
  <constructor-arg index="1" value="BATCH" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
	  
      Now all your statements will be batched so the following could be coded
      in a DAO
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
 public void insertUsers(User[] users) {
   SqlSession sqlSession = getSqlSession();
   for (User user : users) {
   	sqlSession.insert("org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapper.insertUser", user);
   }
 }]]></programlisting>       
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that this configuration style only needs to be used if the desired
      execution method differs from the default set for the
      <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal>. The caveat to this form is that
      there <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be an existing transaction running with
      a different ExecutorType when this method is called. Either ensure that
      calls to <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal>s with different executor
      types run in a separate transaction, with PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW or
      completely outside of a transaction.
    </para>
