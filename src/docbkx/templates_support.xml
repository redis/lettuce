<chapter id="templates_support">
  <title>Obtaining a SqlSession</title>
  
  <para>
    In MyBatis you use the <literal>SqlSessionFactoryBean</literal> to create an <literal>SqlSession</literal>. 
    Once you have it you use it to execute your mapped statements, commit or rollback transactions and finally, 
    when it is no longer needed, you close it. 
    With MyBatis-Spring you don´t need to use <literal>SqlSessionFactoryBean</literal> because 
    your beans will be injected with thread safe <literal>SqlSession</literal> that you won't even
    need to commit, rollback or close because that will automatically be done for you.
  </para>  
  
  <section id="templates_support.daosupport">
    <title>SqlSessionDaoSupport</title>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal> is an abstract support class that provides you with a 
      <literal>SqlSession</literal>. Calling <literal>getSqlSession()</literal> you will get a thread 
      safe <literal>SqlSession</literal> which can then be used to execute SQL methods, like the following:

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class UserMapperDaoImpl extends SqlSessionDaoSupport implements UserMapper {
  public User getUser(String userId) {
    return (User) getSqlSession()
        .selectOne("org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapper.getUser", userId);
  }
}]]></programlisting>

      Usually <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal> is preferred to this class,
      since it requires no extra code. But, this class is useful if you need
      to do other non-MyBatis work in your DAO and concrete classes are
      required.
    </para>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal> is configured similarly to
      <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal>. It requires either an
      <literal>sqlSessionFactory</literal> or an <literal>sqlSession</literal> 
      property to be set. These can be set explicitly or autowired by Spring. 
      If both properties are set, the SqlSessionFactory is ignored.
    </para>

    <para>
      Assuming a class <literal>UserMapperImpl</literal> that subclasses
      <literal>SqlSessionDaoSupport</literal>, it can be configured in Spring
      like the following:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="userMapper" class="org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapperImpl">
  <property name="sqlSessionFactory" ref="sqlSessionFactory" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="templates_support.template">
    <title>SqlSessionTemplate</title>

    <para>
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> is the heart of MyBatis-Spring.
      This class is responsible for managing MyBatis <literal>SqlSession</literal>s, calling MyBatis SQL methods and
      translating exceptions.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      When calling SQL methods, including any method from Mappers returned from
      <literal>getMapper()</literal>,  <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal>
      will ensure that the <literal>SqlSession</literal> used is the one
      associated with the current Spring transaction. In addition, it manages
      the session life-cycle, including closing, committing or rolling back as
      necessary.      
    </para> 
      
    <para>
      It implements <literal>SqlSession</literal> so that you can use it in the same way you would 
      use a MyBatis <literal>SqlSession</literal>. <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> should 
      <emphasis>always</emphasis> be used instead of <literal>SqlSession</literal> because the base MyBatis 
      <literal>SqlSession</literal> cannot participate in Spring transactions and is not thread safe. 
      Switching between the two classes in the same application can cause data integrity issues.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is usually not necessary to create or use a <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> directly. 
      In most cases, <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal>, which uses a template internally,
      will be all that is needed. When access to an <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> is needed, 
      it can be created using an <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> as a constructor argument.

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[SqlSession sqlSsession = new SqlSessionTemplate(sqlSessionFactory);]]></programlisting>
      
      Similarly, the template could be configured in a Spring XML file.
    </para>

    <para>
	  <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal> has also a constructor that gets an <literal>ExecutorType</literal> 
	  as an argument so you can construct, for example, a batch <literal>SqlSession</literal>.
	  Put the following in Spring's applicationContext.xml:  
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<bean id="sqlSession" class="org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionTemplate">
  <constructor-arg index="0" ref="sqlSessionFactory" />
  <constructor-arg index="1" value="BATCH" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
	  
	  Inject the template to you bean:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="userMapper" class="org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapperImpl">
  <property name="sqlSession" ref="sqlSession" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>  
	  
	  And now all your statements will be batched:
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
 public void insertUsers(User[] users) {
   SqlSession sqlSession = getSqlSession();
   for (User user : users) {
   	sqlSession.insert("org.mybatis.spring.sample.mapper.UserMapper.insertUser", user);
   }
 };]]></programlisting>       
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that this method should be used if the desired execution method differs from the 
      default set for the <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal>. The only caveat to
      this form of the method is that there <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be an
      existing transaction running with a different ExecutorType when this
      method is called. Either ensure that calls to
      <literal>execute(SqlSessionCallback, ExecutorType)</literal> run in a
      separate transaction, with PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW or with completely
      outside of a transaction.
    </para>
  </section>
