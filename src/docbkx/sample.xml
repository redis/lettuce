<chapter id="sample">
  <title>Sample Code</title>

  <para>
    You can check out sample code from the MyBatis repository on Google Code.

  <para>
    Any of the samples can be run with JUnit 4.
  </para>
  <para>
    The sample code shows a typical design where a transactional service gets domain objects
    from a data access layer.
  </para>
  <para>    
    The service is composed by an interface <literal>FooService.java</literal>
    and an implementation <literal>FooServiceImpl.java</literal>. This service is transactional
    so a transaction is started when any of its methods is called and commited when 
    the method ends without throwing a unchecked exception.
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Transactional
public interface FooService {
  User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId);
}]]></programlisting>
    Notice that transactional behaviour is configured with the
    <literal>@Transactional</literal> attribute. This is not required; any
    other way provided by Spring can be used to demarcate your transactions. 
  </para>

  <para>
    This service calls a data access layer built with MyBatis. This layer is composed
    by a MyBatis mapper interface <literal>UserMapper.java</literal> and optionally 
    by a implementation <literal>UserMapperImpl.java</literal> 
  </para>
  <para>
    In all the samples the mapper is injected into the service bean so the service code
    is just the following: 
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class FooServiceImpl implements FooService {
  private UserMapper userMapper;

  public void setUserMapper(UserMapper userMapper) {
    this.userMapper = userMapper;
  }

  public User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId) {
    return this.userMapper.getUser(userId);
  }
}]]></programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
    The database access layer has been implemented using the some of the different
    techniques explained in this manual. 
    <literal>SampleBasicTest</literal> will show you the recommended and simplest configuration 
    based on a MapperFactoryBean. 
    <literal>SampleAutoTest</literal> shows a minimal xml configuration based on 
    component scanning and autowiring. 
    <literal>SampleSqlSessionTest</literal> will show you how to hand code
    a DAO using a Spring managed SqlSession. 
    And finally <literal>SampleBatchTest</literal> will show how to use a batch session. 
    Please have a look at the different <literal>applicationContext.xml</literal> 
    files to see MyBatis-Spring in action.
