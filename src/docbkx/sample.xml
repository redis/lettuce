	<title>Sample Code</title>

	<para>
		You can check out sample code from the MyBatis repository on Google Code.

	<para>
		Any of the samples can be run with JUnit 4.
  </para>
	<para>
		The sample code shows a typical design where a transactional service gets
		domain objects from a data access layer.
  </para>
	<para>
		The service is composed by an interface <literal>FooService.java</literal>
		and an implementation <literal>FooServiceImpl.java</literal>. This service is transactional
		so a transaction is started when any of its methods is called and committed when
		the method ends without throwing an unchecked exception.
		<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Transactional
public interface FooService {
  User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId);
}]]></programlisting>
		Notice that transactional behaviour is configured with the <literal>@Transactional</literal>
		attribute. This is not required; any other way provided by Spring can be used to demarcate 
		your transactions.
	</para>

	<para>
		This service calls a data access layer built with MyBatis. This layer
		is composed by a MyBatis mapper interface <literal>UserMapper.java</literal>
		and a DAO composed by an interface <literal>UserDao.java</literal>
		and its corresponding implementation <literal>UserMapperImpl.java</literal>
	</para>
	<para>
		In all the samples the mapper/Dao is injected into the service bean so the
		service code is just the following:
		<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class FooServiceImpl implements FooService {
  private UserMapper userMapper;

  public void setUserMapper(UserMapper userMapper) {
    this.userMapper = userMapper;
  }

  public User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId) {
    return this.userMapper.getUser(userId);
  }
}]]></programlisting>
	</para>

	<para>
		The database access layer has been implemented using the some of the
		different techniques explained in this manual.
