      You can have a look or check out sample code from MyBatis repository on Google Code.

    <para>
      To run the sample just run MyBatisSampleTest.java with JUnit 4.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>FooService</literal> acts as a transactional service. It starts and ends a transaction when any 
      of its methods is called. Have a look to <literal>FooService.java</literal> to see how transactional 
      behaviour is configured with the <literal>@Transactional</literal> attribute.
      This is just a sample, you can use any other way provided by Spring to demarcate your transactions. 
    </para>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
@Transactional
public interface FooService {

    User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId);

}]]>
      </programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>FooServiceImpl.java</literal> is the FooService implementation and it just uses DAOs/mappers that 
      Spring has injected during startup. You will notice that your code does not need to call any Spring or Mybatis methods.
    </para>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public class FooServiceImpl implements FooService {

    private UserMapper userMapper;

    public void setUserMapper(UserMapper userMapper) {
        this.userMapper = userMapper;
    }

    public User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId) {
        return this.userMapper.getUser(userId);
    }
}
]]>
      </programlisting>
    
    <para>
      The database access layer has been implemented using the three different techniques explanied
      in this manual. Have a look at <literal>context.xml</literal>.
