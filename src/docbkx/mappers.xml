        <title>Injecting Mappers</title>
        <para>
            The most interesting feature of MyBatis 3 is mappers. MyBatis-Spring lets you inject mappers on your service
            beans. When using mappers there is no need to use MyBatis API (<literal>selectOne</literal>,
            <literal>selectList</literal>, <literal>insert</literal>, <literal>update</literal>...) you simply call your
            mappers as you have always called your DAOs.
        </para>
        <para>
            This is the way you create a mapper:
            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="userMapper3" class="org.mybatis.spring.MapperFactoryBean">
    <property name="sqlSessionFactory" ref="sqlSessionFactory" />
    <property name="mapperInterface" value="sample.UserMapper" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
            When using mappers you don't need to set up mapper list on the <literal>mybatis-config.xml</literal> file
            because mappers are able to register themselves to MyBatis during startup. If you don't want you mappers to
            self-register set the <literal>addToConfig</literal> property to <literal>false</literal>.
        </para>

        <para>
            You inject mappers directy on your business/service objets in the same way you usually inject DAOs:
            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="fooService3" class="sample.FooServiceImpl">
    <property name="userMapper" ref="userMapper3" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
            With injected mappers your code will have no MyBatis-Spring dependencies and no MyBatis dependencies either.
