    <title>Injecting Mappers</title>
    <para>
      Mybatis-spring lets you inject mappers into your service
      beans. When using mappers you simply call your
      mappers as you have always called your DAOs, but this time you won´t need 
      to code any DAO implementation because MyBatis will do it for you. 
    </para>
    <para>
      With injected mappers your code will have no mybatis-spring dependencies and no MyBatis dependencies either.
    </para>
    <para>
      We have this simple mapper in our application. As you know a mapper is just an interface:
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public interface UserMapper {
    User getUser(String userId);
}]]>
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      This is the way you set up this mapper with mybatis-spring:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<bean id="userMapper" class="org.mybatis.spring.MapperFactoryBean">
    <property name="sqlSessionFactory" ref="sqlSessionFactory" />
    <property name="mapperInterface" value="sample.UserMapper" />
</bean>]]>
      </programlisting>
      When using mappers you don't need to set up mapper list on the <literal>mybatis-config.xml</literal> file
      because mappers are able to register themselves to MyBatis during startup.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now your mapper is ready to be injected on your service objects:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<bean id="fooService" class="sample.FooServiceImpl">
    <property name="userMapper" ref="userMapper" />
</bean>]]>
      </programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="mappers.scanner">
    <title>Mapper scanning</title>
    <para>
      There is no need to register all your mappers on your <literal>applicationContext.xml</literal>, you
      can use the <literal>MapperScanner</literal> that search your classpath for your mappers and will set
      them up.        
    </para>
    <para>
      This is the way you set up a <literal>MapperScanner</literal>
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
	<bean class="org.mybatis.spring.annotation.MapperScanner">
		<property name="basePackage" value="sample" />
        <property name="sqlSessionFactory" ref="sqlSessionFactory" />
	</bean>]]>
      </programlisting>
      <literal>basePackage</literal> is an optional property that lets you specify the base package were 
      your mappers are. Mappers will be searched recursively starting in the specified package.
    </para>
    <para>
      Mappers are just interfaces so to let MapperScanner identify them they must be annotated with
      <literal>@Mapper</literal> annotation.   
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
@Mapper("userMapper")
public interface UserMapper {
    User getUser(String userId);
}]]>
      </programlisting>
      <literal>@Mapper</literal> annotation lets you specify a name for your bean. If you don´t provide a name it
      will be registered with its class name.
    </para>
