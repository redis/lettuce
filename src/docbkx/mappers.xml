<chapter id="mappers">
  <title>MapperFactoryBean</title>

  <para>
    Rather than code data access objects (DAOs) manually, Mybatis-Spring
    provides a dynamic proxy implmentation:
    <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal>. This class lets you inject data
    mapper interfaces directly into your service beans. When using mappers you
    simply call them as you have always  called your DAOs, but you won't need
    to code any DAO implementation because MyBatis-Spring will create a proxy
    for you. 
  </para>

  <para>
    With injected mappers your code will have no direct dependencies on MyBatis,
    Spring or MyBatis-Spring. The proxy that
    <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal> creates handles opening and closing the
    session as well as translating any exceptions into Spring
    <literal>DataAccessExceptions</literal>. In addition, the proxy will
    start a new Spring transaction if required or participate in an existing
    one if necessary. 
  </para>

  <section id="mappers.setup">
    <title>Setup</title>
    <para>
      A data mapper interface is added to Spring like the following:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="userMapper" class="org.mybatis.spring.MapperFactoryBean">
  <property name="mapperInterface" value="sample.UserMapper" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal> creates a proxy class that
      implements <literal>UserMapper</literal> and injects it into the
      application. Because a proxy is created at runtime, the specified Mapper
      <emphasis>must</emphasis> be an interface, not an implementation class.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the UserMapper has a corresponding MyBatis XML mapper file, it will be
      parsed automatically by the <literal>MapperFactoryBean</literal> if the
      XML file is in the same classpath location as the Mapper class. There
      is no need to specify the mapper in a MyBatis configuration file unless
      the mapper XML files are in a different location. See the
      SqlSessionFactoryBean's 
      <link linkend="factorybean.configlocation">configLocation</link>
      property for more information.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that while MapperFactoryBean requires either an
      <literal>SqlSessionFactory</literal> or a
      <literal>SqlSessionTemplate</literal>. These will be autowired by Spring
      so neither needs to be set explictly.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="mappers.inject">
    <title>Injecting Mappers</title>

    <para>
       You can inject mappers directly on your business/service objects in the
       same way you inject any other Spring bean:

       <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="fooService" class="sample.FooServiceImpl">
  <property name="userMapper" ref="userMapper" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>

       This bean can be used directly in application logic:

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[public class FooService {
  private UserMapper userMapper;

  ...

  public User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId) {
    return this.userMapper.getUser(userId);
  }
}]]></programlisting>

       Notice that there are no SqlSession or MyBatis references in this code.
       Nor is there any need to create, open or close the session. If there is
       a Spring transaction in progress, the session will also be committed or
       rolledback when the transaction completes. 
     </para>
  </section>

  <section id="mappers.scanner">
    <title>Mapper Scanning</title>
    <para>
      There is no need to register all your mappers in the Spring XML file.
      Instead, you can use a <literal>MapperScanner</literal> that will search
      your classpath for your mappers and set them up automatically.        
    </para>

    <para>
      To set up a <literal>MapperScanner</literal> add the following to the
      Spring configuration:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean class="org.mybatis.spring.annotation.MapperScanner">
  <property name="basePackage" value="sample" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>

      The <literal>basePackage</literal> property lets you set the base package
      for your mapper interface files. You can set more than one package by
      using a semicolon or comma as a separator. Mappers will be searched
      recursively starting in the specified package(s).
    </para>

    <para>
      To enable <literal>MapperScanner</literal> to identify your mapper
      classes they <emphasis>must</emphasis> be annotated with the
      <literal>@Mapper</literal> annotation.   

      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Mapper("userMapper")
public interface UserMapper {
    User getUser(String userId);
}]]></programlisting>

      The <literal>@Mapper</literal> annotation also lets you specify a name
      for your bean. If you don't provide a name it will be registered with its
      class name.
    </para>
