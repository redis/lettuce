<chapter id="transactions">
  <title>Transactions</title>

  <para>
    One of the primary reasons for using MyBatis-Spring is that it allows
    MyBatis to participate in Spring transactions. Rather than create a new
    transaction manager specific to MyBatis, MyBatis-Spring leverages the
    existing <literal>DataSourceTransactionManager</literal> in Spring.
  </para>

  <para>
    Once a Spring PlatformTransactionManager is configured, you can configure
    transactions in Spring as you normally would. Both
    <literal>@Transactional</literal> annotations as well as AOP style
    configurations are supported. A single <literal>SqlSession</literal>
    object will be created and used for the duration of the transaction. This
    session will be committed or rollbacked as appropriate when then
    transaction completes.
  </para>

  <para>
    MyBatis-Spring will transparently manage transactions once they are set up.
    There is no need for additional code in your DAO classes.
  </para>

  <section  id="transactions.datasource">
    <title>Standard Configuration</title>

    <para>
      To enable Spring transaction processing, simply create a
      <literal>DataSourceTransactionManager</literal> in your Spring XML
      configuration file:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="transactionManager"
    class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
  <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      The <literal>DataSource</literal> specified can be any JDBC 
      <literal>DataSource</literal> you would normally
      use with Spring. This includes connection pools as well as <literal>DataSource</literal>s
      obtained through JNDI lookups.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that the <literal>DataSource</literal> specified for the transaction
      manager <emphasis>must</emphasis> be the same one that is used to create
      the <literal>SqlSessionFactoryBean</literal> or transaction management will
      not work.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="transactions.cmt">
    <title>Container Managed Transactions</title>

    <para>
      If you are using a JEE container and would like Spring to participate in
      container managed transactions (CMT), then Spring should be configured
      with a <literal>JtaTransactionManager</literal> or one of its container
      specific subclasses. The easiest way to do this is to use the Spring
      transaction namespace:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<tx:jta-transaction-manager />]]></programlisting>

      In this configuration, MyBatis will behave like any other Spring
      transactional resource configured with CMT. Spring will automatically use
      any existing container transaction and attach an <literal>SqlSession</literal> to it. If no
      transaction is started and one is needed based on the transaction
      configuration, Spring will start a new container managed transaction.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that if you want to use CMT and do <emphasis>not</emphasis> want to
      use Spring transaction management, you <emphasis>must</emphasis>
      configure the <literal>SqlSessionFactoryBean</literal> to use the base MyBatis
      <literal>ManagedTransactionFactory</literal>:

      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="sqlSessionFactory" class="org.mybatis.spring.SqlSessionFactoryBean"> 
  <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
  <property name="transactionFactoryClass"
    value="org.apache.ibatis.transaction.managed.ManagedTransactionFactory" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>
