    <title>Why mybatis-spring - Motivation</title>
    <para>
      Every Spring user was impatiently waiting for the 3.X release, but unfortunately once released,
      MyBatis users where terribly disappointed: their preferred SQL Mapping Framework was no more supported.
      After many request of including the integration and a good number of patches submitted on the Spring Jira
      <ulink url="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-5991">issue</ulink>, once the issue was accepted
      but announced to be delayed, the MyBatis community thought it was time to reunite the interested people and
      contributors and start the Spring integration made by the community itself.
    </para>

      So, this small library intends to create the missing perfect glue
      between the two popular frameworks, reducing the boilerplate and
      redundant code that users have to write to configure and use MyBatis
      into a Spring 3.X context.

    <title>Requirements</title>
    <para>
      Before starting reading the manual, it is very important you're
      familiar with both MyBatis and Spring framework and terminology,
      otherwise it would be very difficult to understand the described context.
    </para>
    <para>
      Like MyBatis, mybatis-spring requires Java 5 or higher.

    <title>Acknowledgements</title>
    <para>
      A special thanks goes to all the special people who made this project
      a reality. Hunter Presnall and Putthibong Boonbong who made all the hard coding, 
      Eduardo Macarron for the MapperFactoryBean and documentation, Andrius Juozapaitis,
      Giovanni Cuccu and Raj Nagappan for their contributions and support and Simone Tripodi
      for finding them and bringing them all to the project ;) 
      Without them, that project wouldn't exist.
